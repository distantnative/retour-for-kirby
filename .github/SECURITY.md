## Reporting a vulnerability

If you have spotted a vulnerability in Retour, please make sure to let us know immediately. We take any report very seriously and we will react as soon as possible.

You can always write us directly at nico@getkirby.com.

Please do not write to us publicly, e.g. in an issue, as making security vulnerabilities public before they are fixed can give attackers valuable time to exploit the issue. By letting us know directly, you can protect other users from such attacks.
