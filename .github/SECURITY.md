## Reporting a vulnerability

If you have spotted a vulnerability in Retour, please make sure to let me know immediately. I take any report very seriously and will react as soon as possible.

You can always write me directly at nico@getkirby.com.

Please do not write to me publicly, e.g. in an issue, as making security vulnerabilities public before they are fixed can give attackers valuable time to exploit the issue. By letting me know directly, you can protect other users from such attacks.
