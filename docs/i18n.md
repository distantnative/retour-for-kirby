::: info
Retour could feature translations for all languages that Kirby supports as UI languages in the Panel. A list can be found [here](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/tree/master/i18n/translations).

If you would like to help, you can either head over to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby) and start translating. Or you fork the Retour GitHub repo (`dev` branch), create a new i18n file for your translation (based on [`en.json`](https://github.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby/blob/master/src/i18n/en.json)) and open a PR. Or you simply post the strings in a new issue in the repo.
