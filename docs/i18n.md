# Translations

Retour has been translated into the following languages, thanks to the following contributors:

- English

- Brazilian Portuguese: [pedroborges](https://github.com/pedroborges)
- Turkish: [afbora](https://github.com/afbora)

::: info
Retour could feature translations for all languages that Kirby supports as UI languages in the Panel. A list can be found [here](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/tree/master/i18n/translations) (still a few to go for Retour).

So how can you help? Take a look at the English translation file for reference what language strings are needed:

You can either head over to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby) and start translating or fork this repo (develop branch), create a new i18n file for your translation and open a PR. Or you simply post the strings in a new issue here in the repo.
